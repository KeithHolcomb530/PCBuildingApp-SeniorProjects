Description: PostgreSQL Database Server instructions.
	These instructions are to install a PostgreSQL database using the .sql file backup,
	as well as instructions for connecting to the database with the PC Building App application.
--------------------



The included .sql file, named "pcBuildingAppPostgreSQLDatabaseBackup.sql",
is a backup of the entire PC Building App database.
My project uses a PostgreSQL database server to run the SQL tables, so installing PostgreSQL will be required.



----- INSTALL POSTGRESQL 17 WITH PGADMIN 4 -----
To import this backup on a different PC/client, PostgreSQL version 17 must be installed on the device.
The PostgreSQL download link: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

Make sure to download the PostgreSQL installer for the easiest setup.
In the PostgreSQL installer, make sure to select to install each of the following:
	PostgreSQL Server
	pgAdmin 4
	Stack Builder
	Command Line Tools
	
pgAdmin 4 is especially important, as it is an application that can manage the PostgreSQL Server.



----- CREATE A NEW DATABASE IN PGADMIN 4 -----
Once everything is installed, open the pgAdmin 4 application located within the installed directory.
For me, the application would be found here:
	"C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\pgAdmin 4\runtime\pgAdmin4.exe"

Within the pgAdmin 4 UI, there should be a drop-down, starting with 'Servers'.
Go ahead and access the drop-down to see the 'Databases':
	Servers
		^ PostgreSQL 17
			^ Databases
			
Right click on 'Databases' and click to 'Create' -> 'Database...'
A window will popup, go ahead and give the database the name "pcbuildingapp" and save it.
	(May be able to get away with naming it something else, but the import might require the same database name.)



----- IMPORT .SQL BACKUP TO DATABASE -----
Right click on the newly created database and select the 'Restore...' option.
Under the 'Filename', click the folder icon to select the included .sql file,
"pcBuildingAppPostgreSQLDatabaseBackup.sql".

After selecting the .sql file, click the 'Restore' button.

pgAdmin 4 should go through the process of loading the database from the backup.



----- CHECKING WITHIN PC BUILDING APP -----
When attempting to run the PC Building App project,
the class named 'PostgreSQLController' holds static functions to connecting to the database.

These functions are located towards the top of the 'PostgreSQLController'
are getUrl(), getUser(), and getPass().

By default, these functions should be as follows:
	private static String getUrl() { return "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/pcbuildingapp"; }
    private static String getUser() { return "pcbuildingapp_user"; }
    private static String getPass() { return "PCBuildingApp246!"; }

The url, user or pass may need to be changed depending
on how the PostgreSQL server is running on the computer.
If the link to the database is different, the getUrl() function will need to be adjusted.

The getUser() and getPass() are accessing
a user I created for the application to have read/write access to the database.
If the backup did not also backup the database user I created,
updating the getUrl() and getPass() functions may be required.

If the provided getUser() and getPass() do not allow access to the database,
changing these to a username and password that has access to the database created on the computer should work.
