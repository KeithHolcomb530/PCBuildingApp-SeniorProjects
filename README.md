This is my "PC Building App" project repository.

The "PC Building App" project is a Java-based project that allows the user to create and discover 'PC Build Lists' which can contain computer parts for building a PC.
The project utilizes JavaFX to create the user interfaces, as well as a PostgreSQL database to manage and store user-created accounts, 'PC Build Lists', as well as all the various computer parts that users can put into their 'PC Build Lists'.

This repository contains all documentation of the 'PC Building App'.
This includes the design documents, as well as the example database (included as an SQL file), and even the project itself (exported from IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2024.3.4).

The repository also includes the final report written on this project.
The final report can be found within the main repository folder.
Note that the final report is rather lengthy.
